This is a simple piece of code used to evaluate both an RK3 algorithm as well as a DIRK3 algorithm based on the first coursework for MATH3018. 

Although it achieved full marks, this has been uploaded purely to assist other students taking the module. It is rudimentary and has been applied only to specific situations. 

Easy improvements can be made, such as looping over indices to plot rather than writing each index out separately.
